# Quick Start Guide

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub or download the zip file and extract it.
2. Open the Google Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. At the top right, turn on `Developer mode`.
4. Click `Load unpacked`.
5. Navigate to the project directory and select it.

## Setup

1. After installation, you should be automatically redirected to its setup page.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the setup guide:

   - **Step 1**: Generate an OAuth token from your Twitch account. This is necessary for the application to send the ping message. You can generate the token by clicking the "Generate token" button or manually at [Twitchapps.com](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).

   - **Step 2**: Insert your Twitch username (and the OAuth token if you chose manually) you generated in step 1 into the respective fields and click "Save". Once saved, the input fields will be disabled to prevent accidental changes.

## Usage

- The application maintains a list of up to 50 names from the chat. You can see the number of stored names below your chat, indicated as for example '41xðŸ””'.
- Clicking the bell icon sends a ping message in the chat. But if you wait untill it hits 50x, it will send two seperate messages with 50 unique names.
- When the list of names gets full, the system replaces old stored names with new ones so both messages will contain up to date names of active chatters.

## Customization

- If you wish to adjust the maximum number of stored names, you'll need to edit the `collectNames()` function within the `content.js` file.
- If you want to modify the emotes used in the ping, you'll need to edit the `sendAlert()` function within the `content.js` file.
- To expand the blacklist with additional names, you can add the names to the `blacklist` array in the `content.js` file.

## Known bug

- If you get timed out, you need to refresh page to make the button re-appear.

## Support

- If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please open an issue on GitHub or dm me on Twitch.
