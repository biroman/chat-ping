# Quick Start Guide

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub or download the zip file and extract it.
2. Open the Google Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. At the top right, turn on `Developer mode`.
4. Click `Load unpacked`.
5. Navigate to the project directory and select it.

## Setup

1. After installation, you should be automatically redirected to its setup page.
2. Click "Connect to twitch" and after doing that, you should be good to go.

## Usage

- The application maintains a list of up to 40 names from the chat. You can see the number of stored names below your chat, indicated as for example '23xüîî'.
- Clicking the bell icon sends a ping message in the chat. But if you wait until it hits 40x, it will send two separate messages with 40 unique names.
- When the list of names gets full, the system replaces old stored names with new ones so both messages will contain up to date names of active chatters.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

**Please note that indiscriminately pinging random usernames could lead to a temporary chat timeout. This can occur if Fossabot flags certain usernames as inappropriate or profane. To avoid this, if you identify or encounter usernames that result in a timeout, please manually add them to your blacklist.**

## Customization

- If you wish to adjust the maximum number of stored names, you'll need to edit the `collectNames()` function within the `content.js` file.
- If you want to modify the emotes used in the ping, you'll need to edit the `sendAlert()` function within the `content.js` file.
- To expand the blacklist with additional names, you can add the names through the options page.
